# LReadability

A chrome/chromium extension for improved readability.

It uses original javascript code
from [arc90](https://code.google.com/archive/p/arc90labs-readability/).

The main difference from other readability extensions is that it runs
fully locally. No data is sent to a third app or a web service (like
Mercury Reader), your privacy is safe. Also the css is fully
customisable.
